# pi-power-button

Fork from the "Pi power button guide" - this also adds flashing lights on powerup and shutdown (as well as a power light)

Modified scripts based on the [Pi power button guide](https://howchoo.com/g/mwnlytk3zmm/how-to-add-a-power-button-to-your-raspberry-pi) on howchoo.

## Layout

Breadboard implementation, showing both the on/off switch as well as the "traffic light" set of lights

You may need to up the resistor for R1 to 1K depending on how much power your Pi is drawing
